        <p><span class="fw-bold">Course Description:</span> In this course we will learn about the evolution of proofs
          in
          computer science. In
          particular,
          we will learn about fascinating proof systems such as interactive proofs, multi-prover interactive proofs and
          probabilistically checkable proofs. We will then show how to use cryptography to convert these powerful proof
          systems into succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs).

        <p><span class="fw-bold">Scribe Notes: </span>Each student should write up scribe notes (in LaTeX) for one
          lecture.
          These notes will be posted on the course website. </p>
        <p><span class="fw-bold">Reading Project: </span>By the end of the semester, each student should read a paper
          (or
          perhaps two related papers) and write an exposition of the results of the paper(s). A list of papers for
          potential
          projects is posted below (although you are more than welcome to pick papers that are not on the list).</p>
